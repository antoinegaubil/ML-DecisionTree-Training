# Decision Tree Classifier Training

## Overview
This script showcases the application of Decision Tree classifiers in machine learning. It performs training on two distinct datasets, namely Penguins and Abalones, utilizing the scikit-learn library for model creation, visualization, and tuning.

## Datasets
The script uses two datasets:
- Penguins dataset: 'penguins.csv'
- Abalones dataset: 'abalone.csv'

## Outputs
The script generates pie charts illustrating class distributions and Decision Tree visualizations for both base and top models.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
The script performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and outputs the best hyperparameters for the top Decision Tree models.
